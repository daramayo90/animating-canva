# Animating Canvas

## Creating and Resizing Your Canvas
A Canvas can be easy created by putting the following tag <canvas></canvas>

## Drawing Elements
Once the Canvas is created, the next thing to do is manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
So, a canvas.js file is created and select the canvas using 'querySelector'

### Canvas Objects which can be created:
- Rectangles --> fillRect(x, y, width, heigth)
- Lines --> moveTo(x, y) / lineTo(x, y)
- Arcs / Circles --> arc()
- Bezier curves
- Images
- Text
